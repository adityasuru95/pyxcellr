# PyxcellR

PyxcellR is a package to simultaneously analyze and integrate pixel level information and cell level information from assays such as spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry. 

Assays such as spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry attempt to quantify the gene or protein level information at cellular level, or a groups of cell levels. Almost always, these assays are paired with imaging data such as haematoxylin and eosin images which gives detailed picture of the tissue. 

The goal of the project is to build a package which will allow for computational biology researchers to perform multi-modal integration of their datasets.

Spatial biology experiments include 2 components. One is imaging which is barely used. And another is the gene expression. Which people use the most. Even if they use the imaging component, there are no easy-to-use tools which will allow in a streamlined fashion how to train the pixel level data with the corresponding gene expression data. 

The data for the project will be sourced from the various publicly

Each spatial transcriptomics experiment gives about 5000 data points. Each data point consists of 1 image of the tissue about 55um in diameter or about 172um2 in area. A high powered digital picture of the spot is taken 

4 datasets cost 10k. Each dataset consists of 5000 spots.
