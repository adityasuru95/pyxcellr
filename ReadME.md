# PyxcellR

PyxcellR is a package to simultaneously analyze and integrate pixel level information and cell level information from assays such as spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry. 

Assays such as spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry attempt to quantify the gene or protein level information at cellular level, or a groups of cell levels. Almost always, these assays are paired with imaging data such as haematoxylin and eosin images which gives detailed picture of the tissue.
